# mcpi_pong

This is an absolutely silly project...

A simple pong game for mcpi rendered against a screen of blocks in Minecraft.  This is built to be used with mcpi (https://github.com/martinohanlon/mcpi).  Install mcpi on your Minecraft server before cloning and running this repo

Players move along "paddles" to control ships on a screen rendered in minecraft for a simple game of pong

This project creates a basic graphics engine for 2d rasterization of colored wool blocks in MineCraft.  The engine consists of a screen with two virtual pages, and optimized page-flipping so only changed pixels are rendered.
